Remove Consecutive Characters
Problem Description

Given a string A and integer B, remove all consecutive same characters that have length exactly B.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100000

1 <= B <= |A|



Input Format
First Argument is string A.

Second argument is integer B.



Output Format
Return a string after doing the removals.



Example Input
Input 1:

A = "aabcd"
B = 2
Input 2:

A = "aabbccd"
B = 2


Example Output
Output 1:

 "bcd"
Output 2:

 "d"


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 "aa" had length 2.
Explanation 2:

 "aa", "bb" and "cc" had length of 2.
 // java Code
    public class Solution {
        public String solve(String A, int B) {
            int n = A.length();
            if(n==1){
                return A;
            }
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            int i=0;
            while(i<n){
                int j=i;
                while(j<n && A.charAt(i)==A.charAt(j)){
                    j++;
                }
                if(j-i==B){
                    i=j;
                }else{
                    while(i<j){
                        sb.append(A.charAt(i));
                        i++;
                    }
                }
            }
            return sb.toString();
        }

        Reverse the String
        Problem Description
        You are given a string A of size N.

        Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

        NOTE:

        A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
        Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
        If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.


        Problem Constraints
        1 <= N <= 3 * 105



        Input Format
        The only argument given is string A.



        Output Format
        Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.



        Example Input
        Input 1:
        A = "the sky is blue"
        Input 2:
        A = "this is ib"


        Example Output
        Output 1:
        "blue is sky the"
        Output 2:
        "ib is this"


        Example Explanation
        Explanation 1:
        We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "blue is sky the".
        Explanation 2:
        We reverse the string word by word so the string becomes "ib is this".

        // java Code
        public class Solution {
            public String solve(String A) {
                String[] arr = A.split(" ");
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                for(int i=arr.length-1;i>=0;i--){
                    sb.append(arr[i]);
                    sb.append(" ");
                }
                return sb.toString().trim();
            }
        }
