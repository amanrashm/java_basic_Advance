Manual Steps for WSL Installations:
Step 1 - Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

Step 2 - Check requirements for running WSL 2
For x64 systems: Version 1903 or later, with Build 18362.1049 or later.
For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or later, with Build 19041 or later.

Step 3 - Enable Virtual Machine feature
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Step 4 - Download the Linux kernel update package
systeminfo | find "System Type"
Download and Install - WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines
https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.win...
wsl.exe --update

Step 5 - Set WSL 2 as your default version
wsl --set-default-version 2

Step 6 - Install your Linux distribution of choice
wsl -l -o
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

Step 7 - Verify WSL Instalation:
wsl --version

Step 8 - Proceed for Docker Installation
